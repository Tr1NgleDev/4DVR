# 4DVR

Adds VR support (through SteamVR) to 4D Miner!  

> [!NOTE]
> This mod is still in BETA.

## Features:
- (WIP) Multiplayer Support (no need for a server-side mod, [Sync](https://github.com/Tr1NgleDev/Sync) recommended for a better experience, preferably server-side aswell (`4d4t.org` recommended))
- NON-VR Mode so that Flatscreen players can see VR players in Multiplayer! (also so that you don't have to toggle the mod on/off ig)
- W(-Depth) Perception! (OFF by default)
- Quick Actions Menu
- [4DKeyBinds](https://github.com/Tr1NgleDev/4DKeyBinds) Support for Controller Bindings AND in the Quick Actions Menu
- Somewhat compatible with most mods
- An [API](/4DVR.h) for making mods compatible with 4DVR (not tested yet)
- Breaking Blocks and Attacking Entities by punching
- VR-ified Tutorial Section! ( you can spin forg :D )

## Known Bugs/Problems:
- The 4DModLoader Mod Menu does not work properly. (i don't think i can fix that, atleast not yet)
- Some custom menus might not work properly or work partially, can be fixed using the [API](/4DVR.h).
- The Compass item does not render properly in the hand, and overlays the coordinates text on your eyes. (plan to fix)
- No Left-Handed Mode (yet)

## Things i won't be doing:
- OpenXR
- OVR (Oculus VR)
